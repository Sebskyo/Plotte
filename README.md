# Plotte
## What is Plotte?
A plotting program implemented in Java.
It's designed to be easily usable with UNIX pipes. For example, you can pipe in results from Sorte, a sorting program.
## How do I install it?
Go to releases and download the jar. If you're on a UNIX system I recommend using these commands:
```
mv Plotte.jar plotte
chmod +x plotte
sudo mv plotte /usr/local/bin/plotte
```
else you can just run it the java way:
```
java -jar Plotte.jar
```
