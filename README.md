# Plotte
## What is Plotte?
A plotting program implemented in Java.
It's designed to be easily usable with UNIX pipes. For example, you can pipe in results from Sorte, a sorting program.
## How do I install it?
Go to releases and download the jar, then run it:
```
java -jar Plotte.jar
```
If you're using unix, you *may* be able to just move the file to /usr/local/bin/ and be able to run it anywhere.

Depending on your system, you might not be able to dotslash execute the jar. You can either change these settings or
create bash script that runs the java command and forwards the given arguments. A quick google search can help you with
either of those options.
